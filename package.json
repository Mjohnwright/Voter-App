  "description": "\"Get Out and Get Involved!\" is an application that reaches out to the community to ensure that polling places are staffed with enough people on election day.  The app takes log-in information from managers and users to create user and manager account. Through the manager account, managers can create events, which are posted on the event listing page. Volunteers sign-up for these events and will receive a text message alerting them when election day gets close.  It is more important than ever to get people engaged and involved, and this app gives people a platform to do so.",
